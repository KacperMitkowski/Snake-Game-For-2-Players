# Snake game for 2 players

## What is Snake?
It's a classical platform game when players have to kill all the mobs (by shooting or touching them) without being killed. Some of the mobs are shooting and some are not. This is a game for 2 players and each of them presses keyboard for snake moving.


## About the project:
It is my implementation of Snake in Java and JavaFX. This is a base for new features such as: new types of mobes, adding new items like walls, saving game etc.

**The goal was to:**
* practice OOP concept in Java
* practice MVC (Model, View, Controller) design pattern in a desktop application
* create a game loop with the option exit and restart game
* use JavaFx as a GUI

## Used technology:
* Java
* JavaFx
* CSS
